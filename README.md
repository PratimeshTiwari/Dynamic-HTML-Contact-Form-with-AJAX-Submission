The "HTML Contact Form" incorporates JavaScript (JS), PHP, and AJAX to create a dynamic and seamless user experience without the need to reload the webpage.

The HTML contact form provides fields for users to input their contact information and message. Upon submission, the JavaScript code captures the form data and sends it asynchronously to the server using AJAX.

The PHP script receives the form data from the AJAX request and processes it on the server-side. It can perform tasks such as sending an email notification with the submitted information or storing it in a database.

The AJAX functionality allows for the data to be sent to the server and receive a response without refreshing or reloading the webpage. This ensures a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.

By combining HTML, JS, PHP, and AJAX, the contact form delivers real-time form submission and processing, enhancing usability and interactivity for users.
